slides;
    What is python / python2/3 , anaconda etc.
	Everything in object in python. Even funtions. myfunc.__doc__
	Python syntax and jupyter features. (link to jupyter cheatsheet).
		%time, multiline output, 
	Great use for yield. (maybe class.)
	pickle. api_level= 2/3
	monkey-patch.


	Goals- Make aware of capabilities of language to avoid re-inventing wheel, doing things badly,
